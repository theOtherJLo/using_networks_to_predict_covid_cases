# using_networks_to_predict_covid_cases
This is the github repo for all the code that will be used in a Medium blog post. The blog post covers why and how we should use networks to predict the spread of Covid-19. Part 1 can be found [here](https://medium.com/@lowe.james/predicting-the-spread-of-covid-19-using-networks-in-r-2fee0013db91). 

This repo uses renv to handle package dependencies. If you are new to renv, you can read more about it [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). 

The workflow looks like:

1) Clone/ fork this repo 
2) Open the R project
3) Install renv if you haven't already (you may be prompted to do this)
4) Run renv::restore()
5) Run the code like you normally would
